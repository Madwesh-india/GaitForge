# ðŸ¦¾ Rigid Body Simulator (Learning Project)

A personal project to learn **C++**, **physics simulation**, and eventually robotics dynamics by building a 2D â†’ 3D physics engine from scratch.  
This README doubles as a **roadmap + checklist** to track concepts, coding tasks, and progress.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goals
- Learn the fundamentals of rigid body physics & numerical simulation.  
- Build a 2D simulator with links, joints, and constraints.  
- Extend to 3D with articulated bodies (robot arms, legged gaits).  
- Optimize for performance (modern C++ + optional GPU).  
- Create a lightweight editor to visualize constraints & joints.

### 4. Multi-Link Systems
- [ ] Generalize solver for multiple constraints  
- [ ] Create closed kinematic chains (e.g. four-bar linkage)  
- [ ] Test with simple walking leg mechanism  

### 5. Contacts & Collisions
- [ ] Implement basic collision detection (circle vs ground, AABB)  
- [ ] Add collision response (impulse-based)  
- [ ] Introduce friction (Coulomb model)  

### 6. Robotics Dynamics
