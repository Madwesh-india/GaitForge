# 🦾 Rigid Body Simulator (Learning Project)

A personal project to learn **C++**, **physics simulation**, and eventually robotics dynamics by building a 2D → 3D physics engine from scratch.  
This README doubles as a **roadmap + checklist** to track concepts, coding tasks, and progress.

## 📌 Project Goals
- Learn the fundamentals of rigid body physics & numerical simulation.  
- Build a 2D simulator with links, joints, and constraints.  
- Extend to 3D with articulated bodies (robot arms, legged gaits).  
- Optimize for performance (modern C++ + optional GPU).  
- Create a lightweight editor to visualize constraints & joints.
